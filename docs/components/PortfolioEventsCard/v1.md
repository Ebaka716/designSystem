# Portfolio Events Card (v1)

## Overview

The `PortfolioEventsCardV1` component displays a summary of upcoming or recent events related to the user's portfolio. It is designed to provide a quick overview of significant dates and stock movements.

This version currently uses static placeholder data. Future versions will accept dynamic data via props.

## Usage

Import the component and use it within your application structure:

```tsx
import { PortfolioEventsCardV1 } from '@/components/PortfolioEventsCard/v1';

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components */}
      <PortfolioEventsCardV1 />
      {/* Other components */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyPage;
```

## Structure

The card utilizes the following sub-components:
- `CardV1`: Provides the main card container and title section.
- `DetailRowV1`: Renders each event item within the card.
- `ButtonV2`: Used for the information icon in the header.
- `lucide-react` icons: Used for visual representation of event types and actions.

## Props

This version of the component does not accept any props. The event data is currently hardcoded within the component.

## Future Enhancements

- Accept dynamic `eventsData` via props.
- Allow customization of the title and info button behavior.
- Potentially extract the `NotificationBadge` into a reusable utility component.

## Description
